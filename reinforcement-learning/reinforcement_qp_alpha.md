# Reinforcement Learning Exam Answers

## Question 1
### (a) What is reinforcement learning, and how does it differ from other machine learning approaches?

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm focused on how an agent should take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. It is characterized by:

1. **Learning through interaction**: The agent learns by interacting with an environment, taking actions, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

2. **Trial and error approach**: The agent must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them out, not by being explicitly told the correct actions.

3. **Delayed rewards**: Unlike other learning approaches, feedback may come long after the action that caused it.

Differences from other machine learning approaches:

| Feature | Reinforcement Learning | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Training data | No labeled examples; learns from interaction | Requires labeled examples | Unlabeled data |
| Feedback | Rewards/penalties (often delayed) | Immediate error signals | No explicit feedback |
| Goal | Learn a policy to maximize rewards | Learn a mapping from inputs to outputs | Find patterns/structure in data |
| Decision process | Sequential decision-making | Single-step decisions | Typically non-sequential |
| Exploration vs. exploitation | Must balance exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions | No exploration needed | No concept of exploration |

### (b) Give examples of real-world applications where reinforcement learning is used.

1. **Game playing**:
   - AlphaGo and AlphaZero for Go, chess, and shogi
   - OpenAI's systems for Dota 2 and StarCraft II
   - Agents trained to play Atari games using only pixel inputs

2. **Robotics**:
   - Teaching robots to walk, run, or manipulate objects

   - Content recommendation on streaming platforms
   - Ad placement and targeting
   - Product recommendations in e-commerce

## Question 2
### (a) Explain bandit algorithm and its role in decision-making.

A bandit algorithm addresses the multi-armed bandit problem, which is a simplified reinforcement learning scenario where:

1. **Problem setting**: An agent must choose between K different actions (or "arms") repeatedly over time.
2. **Feedback**: After each choice, the agent receives a reward only for the chosen action.
3. **Unknown reward distributions**: Each arm has an unknown probability distribution of rewards.
4. **No state transitions**: Unlike full RL, there are no state transitions; each decision is independent.

Key characteristics of bandit algorithms:

1. **Exploration-exploitation tradeoff**: The core challenge is balancing:
   - **Exploration**: Trying different arms to gather information about their reward distributions
   - **Exploitation**: Choosing the currently known best arm to maximize immediate reward

2. **Role in decision-making**:
   - **Simplified learning**: Provides a framework for sequential decision-making without complex state dynamics
   - **Online learning**: Adapts decisions in real-time based on observed outcomes
   - **Sample efficiency**: Makes decisions under uncertainty with limited information

3. **Key metrics**:
   - **Regret**: Measures the difference between the rewards obtained by the algorithm and the rewards that could have been obtained by always choosing the optimal arm
   - **Sample complexity**: The number of trials needed to identify the best arm with high probability

4. **Applications in decision-making**:
   - A/B testing and website optimization
   - Clinical trials for drug testing
   - Ad placement and recommendation systems
   - Resource allocation problems

### (b) Describe UCB algorithm to decide which arm to pull in a multi-armed bandit scenario.

The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a popular approach for the multi-armed bandit problem that effectively balances exploration and exploitation by selecting arms based on their potential upper bound of performance.

**UCB1 Algorithm**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Pull each arm once to get an initial estimate of rewards
   - Record the number of times each arm has been pulled: $N_i(t) = 1$ for all arms initially
   - Calculate the empirical mean reward for each arm: $\hat{\mu}_i$

2. **Arm selection formula**: At each time step t, select arm i that maximizes:
   
   $UCB_i(t) = \hat{\mu}_i + \sqrt{\frac{2\ln(t)}{N_i(t)}}$

   where:
   - $\hat{\mu}_i$ is the empirical mean reward of arm i (exploitation term)
   - $\sqrt{\frac{2\ln(t)}{N_i(t)}}$ is the confidence bound (exploration term)
   - $t$ is the current time step (total number of arm pulls so far)
   - $N_i(t)$ is the number of times arm i has been pulled up to time t

3. **Update procedure** after pulling arm i:
   - Observe reward $r_i$
   - Update the empirical mean: $\hat{\mu}_i = \frac{(N_i(t) \times \hat{\mu}_i) + r_i}{N_i(t) + 1}$
   - Increment the counter: $N_i(t) = N_i(t) + 1$

**Key properties**:

1. **Automatic balance**: The exploration term naturally decreases as an arm is pulled more frequently
2. **Theoretical guarantees**: UCB1 achieves logarithmic regret, which is optimal for this problem
3. **No hyperparameters**: Unlike ε-greedy approaches, UCB doesn't require manually setting exploration parameters

**Example execution**:
- Arms that have high empirical rewards get pulled more often
- Arms that have been pulled less frequently have higher exploration bonuses
- Over time, the algorithm converges to the optimal arm while maintaining some exploration

## Question 3
### (a) How does Median Elimination algorithm work in bandit problems, and why is it useful?

The Median Elimination algorithm is a PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning approach for the best-arm identification problem in multi-armed bandits. Unlike algorithms focused on minimizing regret, Median Elimination aims to identify an ε-optimal arm with high probability using as few samples as possible.

**Algorithm steps**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the full set of arms S = {1, 2, ..., K}
   - Set initial approximation parameter ε₁ = ε/4
   - Set initial confidence parameter δ₁ = δ/2

2. **Iterative elimination process**:
   - **Round r**:
     a. Sample each remaining arm in S for m = Θ(1/(εᵣ²) · log(1/δᵣ)) times
     b. Calculate empirical mean reward μ̂ᵢ for each arm i in S
     c. Find the median value M of these empirical means
     d. Eliminate all arms with μ̂ᵢ ≤ M (the bottom half of arms)
     e. Update S to contain only the remaining arms
     f. Update parameters: εᵣ₊₁ = 3εᵣ/4 and δᵣ₊₁ = δᵣ/2

3. **Termination**:
   - Continue until only one arm remains in S
   - Return this arm as the estimated best arm

**Why it's useful**:

1. **Theoretical guarantees**: With probability at least 1-δ, it returns an arm with expected reward within ε of the optimal arm's reward

2. **Sample efficiency**: Achieves near-optimal sample complexity of O((K/ε²)·log(1/δ)) for identifying an ε-optimal arm

3. **Robust approach**: The median-based elimination is more robust to outliers than approaches that eliminate based on fixed thresholds

4. **Parameter-free**: Does not require knowledge of the reward ranges or variances

5. **Applications**:
   - Clinical trials with limited testing budget
   - System optimization with expensive evaluation
   - Any scenario where identifying a near-optimal option with minimal sampling is important

The key innovation of Median Elimination is its ability to provide formal guarantees on both the quality of the selected arm and the number of samples required, making it particularly valuable for applications where sampling is expensive or time-consuming.

### (b) What is a policy gradient in bandit algorithms, and how does it help the agent learn to make better decisions over time?

Policy gradient methods in the context of bandit problems represent a direct approach to learning a decision-making policy by parameterizing the policy and updating the parameters in the direction of higher expected rewards.

**Policy gradient in bandit context**:

1. **Policy representation**:
   - Define a parameterized policy π_θ(a) that gives the probability of selecting each action a
   - For K-armed bandits, typically use a softmax policy:
     π_θ(a) = exp(θₐ) / Σₖexp(θₖ)
   - The parameter vector θ = (θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₖ) determines action preferences

2. **Objective function**:
   - Maximize the expected reward: J(θ) = Σₐ π_θ(a) · r(a)
   - where r(a) is the expected reward for action a

3. **Policy gradient update**:
   - Compute gradient: ∇J(θ) = Σₐ ∇π_θ(a) · r(a)
   - In practice, use the likelihood ratio trick to estimate gradient using only the chosen action:
     ∇J(θ) ≈ ∇log(π_θ(a_t)) · r_t
   - Update rule: θ ← θ + α · ∇log(π_θ(a_t)) · r_t
     where α is the learning rate, a_t is the chosen action, and r_t is the observed reward

**How it helps improve decisions over time**:

1. **Gradient-based improvement**:
   - Parameters are updated in the direction that increases the probability of actions that yielded high rewards
   - Parameters for actions that lead to low rewards are decreased
   - Policy naturally shifts toward more rewarding actions

2. **Probabilistic exploration**:
   - Maintains a probability distribution over actions, enabling natural exploration
   - As learning progresses, probabilities concentrate on better actions
   - No need for explicit exploration strategies like ε-greedy or UCB

3. **Advantages for bandit problems**:
   - **Online learning**: Updates can be done after each action-reward observation
   - **Adaptability**: Can adjust to changing reward distributions
   - **Scalability**: Works well with large action spaces when using function approximation
   - **Continuous action spaces**: Can be extended to continuous actions more naturally than value-based methods

4. **Learning dynamics**:
   - Initially explores broadly due to similar action probabilities
   - Gradually shifts probability mass toward better-performing actions
   - Converges to selecting the optimal action with highest probability

This approach provides a theoretically grounded method for solving bandit problems with provable convergence properties while maintaining an elegant balance between exploration and exploitation through the probabilistic policy.

## Question 4
### (a) Explain full RL algorithm in detail.

The "full RL algorithm" refers to a complete reinforcement learning approach that addresses the general sequential decision-making problem, unlike bandit algorithms which handle single-state problems. A comprehensive full RL algorithm includes environment modeling, policy learning, value estimation, and exploration strategies.

**Components of a Full RL Algorithm**:

1. **Environment Model**:
   - **State space S**: Set of all possible states of the environment
   - **Action space A**: Set of all possible actions the agent can take
   - **Transition function P(s'|s,a)**: Probability of reaching state s' when taking action a in state s
   - **Reward function R(s,a,s')**: Reward received after transitioning from s to s' via action a
   - **Discount factor γ**: Value between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of future rewards

2. **Policy π(a|s)**: 
   - Defines the agent's behavior by specifying the probability of taking action a in state s
   - Can be deterministic: a = π(s) or stochastic: π(a|s)

3. **Value Functions**:
   - **State value function V^π(s)**: Expected return when starting in state s and following policy π
     V^π(s) = E_π[Σ γ^t · R_t+1 | S_0 = s]
   - **Action value function Q^π(s,a)**: Expected return when taking action a in state s and following π thereafter
     Q^π(s,a) = E_π[Σ γ^t · R_t+1 | S_0 = s, A_0 = a]

**Example of a Complete Full RL Algorithm: SARSA**

SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an on-policy temporal difference learning algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize Q(s,a) arbitrarily for all state-action pairs
   - Set learning rate α ∈ (0,1] and exploration parameter ε ∈ (0,1]
   - Set discount factor γ ∈ [0,1]

2. **For each episode**:
   - Initialize state s
   - Choose action a from s using policy derived from Q (e.g., ε-greedy)
   
   - **For each step in the episode**:
     a. Take action a, observe reward r and next state s'
     b. Choose action a' from s' using policy derived from Q
     c. Update Q-value:
        Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γQ(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
     d. s ← s', a ← a'
     
   - Continue until s is terminal

3. **Policy improvement**:
   - After updating Q-values, the policy improves by being more greedy with respect to Q
   - Typically use ε-greedy: π(a|s) = 1-ε+ε/|A| if a=argmax Q(s,a'), else ε/|A|

4. **Exploration strategy**:
   - Balance exploration and exploitation using ε-greedy approach
   - Optionally implement ε decay over time to reduce exploration as learning progresses

5. **Convergence**:
   - Under appropriate conditions (sufficient exploration, gradually decreasing α), Q-values converge to optimal Q* values
   - This leads to an optimal policy π*(a|s) that maximizes expected return

**Alternative Full RL Algorithms**:

- **Q-Learning**: Off-policy TD algorithm using Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
- **Actor-Critic**: Combines policy gradient (actor) and value function approximation (critic)
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**: Uses neural networks to approximate Q-values with experience replay and target networks
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Policy gradient method with trust region optimization

A full RL algorithm must address all these components while efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation to learn optimal behavior in complex environments with delayed rewards.

### (b) What are Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and how do they structure decision-making problems in reinforcement learning?

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide the fundamental mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems in reinforcement learning. They formalize environments where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.

**Formal Definition of an MDP**:

An MDP is defined by a 5-tuple (S, A, P, R, γ):

1. **State space S**: 
   - The set of all possible states the environment can be in
   - Can be discrete or continuous
   - Example: In a grid world, states might be the (x,y) coordinates of the agent

2. **Action space A**:
   - The set of all possible actions the agent can take
   - Can be discrete or continuous
   - Example: In a grid world, actions might be {up, down, left, right}

3. **Transition function P**:
   - P(s'|s,a) defines the probability of transitioning to state s' when taking action a in state s
   - Captures the dynamics of the environment
   - Embodies the "Markov property": future states depend only on the current state and action, not on the history

4. **Reward function R**:
   - R(s,a,s') defines the immediate reward received after transitioning from s to s' via action a
   - Sometimes simplified as R(s,a) or even R(s)
   - Specifies the goal of the agent

5. **Discount factor γ ∈ [0,1]**:
   - Determines the present value of future rewards
   - γ=0 makes the agent myopic (considers only immediate rewards)
   - γ close to 1 makes the agent consider long-term rewards

**How MDPs Structure Decision-Making Problems**:

1. **Markov Property**:
   - The key characteristic of MDPs is the Markov property: the future depends only on the present state, not on the history
   - This simplifies the problem significantly as the agent doesn't need to remember the entire history
   - Formally: $P(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t,s_{t-1},a_{t-1},...,s_0,a_0) = P(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$

2. **Goal Formulation**:
   - MDPs formalize the goal as maximizing the expected discounted cumulative reward:
     E[Σ γ^t · R_t]
   - This balances immediate and future rewards based on the discount factor

3. **Policy and Value Functions**:
   - A policy π(a|s) specifies the agent's behavior
   - Value functions (V^π(s) and Q^π(s,a)) evaluate how good states and actions are under a policy
   - Optimal value functions (V*(s) and Q*(s,a)) define the best possible performance

4. **Bellman Equations**:
   - MDPs enable the use of recursive Bellman equations to relate current values to future values
   - For optimal policy:
     V*(s) = max_a [R(s,a) + γ·Σ_s' P(s'|s,a)·V*(s')]
     Q*(s,a) = R(s,a) + γ·Σ_s' P(s'|s,a)·max_a' Q*(s',a')

5. **Solution Methods**:
   - MDPs can be solved using:
     - **Dynamic Programming**: When the model (P and R) is known
     - **Model-Free Methods**: When learning from experience without knowing P and R
     - **Policy Iteration**: Alternating policy evaluation and policy improvement
     - **Value Iteration**: Directly computing optimal value functions

6. **Practical Applications**:
   - MDPs structure a wide range of problems:
     - **Resource allocation**: Managing resources over time
     - **Robot navigation**: Planning paths in uncertain environments
     - **Game playing**: Sequential decision-making in games
     - **Portfolio management**: Investment decisions over time

MDPs provide a principled mathematical framework that enables RL algorithms to learn optimal behavior in sequential decision-making problems with delayed rewards and uncertain outcomes.

## Question 5
### (a) Describe Bellman optimality in reinforcement learning.

Bellman optimality refers to a set of equations that characterize optimal policies and value functions in reinforcement learning. Named after Richard Bellman, these equations establish the recursive relationship between the value of a state (or state-action pair) and the values of subsequent states.

**Bellman Optimality Principle**:

The core idea of Bellman optimality is that an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.

**Bellman Optimality Equations**:

1. **Optimal State Value Function (V*)**:
   
   $V^*(s) = max_a [R(s,a) + γ·Σ_s' P(s'|s,a)·V^*(s')]$

   This equation states that the optimal value of state s is the expected return from:
   - Taking the best possible action a in state s
   - Receiving the immediate reward R(s,a)
   - Transitioning to state s' according to P(s'|s,a)
   - Continuing optimally from state s' (captured by V*(s'))

2. **Optimal Action Value Function (Q*)**:
   
   $Q^*(s,a) = R(s,a) + γ·Σ_s' P(s'|s,a)·max_a' Q^*(s',a')$

   This equation states that the optimal Q-value of taking action a in state s is the expected return from:
   - Taking action a in state s
   - Receiving the immediate reward R(s,a)
   - Transitioning to state s' according to P(s'|s,a)
   - Taking the best possible action a' in state s'

3. **Relationship between V* and Q**:
   
   $V^*(s) = max_a Q^*(s,a)$
   
   The optimal value of a state is the Q-value of the best action in that state.

4. **Optimal Policy (π*)**:
   
   $π^*(s) = argmax_a Q^*(s,a)$
   
   The optimal policy selects the action that maximizes the optimal Q-function.

**Mathematical Properties**:

1. **Contraction Mapping**: The Bellman optimality operator is a contraction mapping in the space of value functions, which guarantees convergence to a unique fixed point.

2. **Fixed Point**: The optimal value functions V* and Q* are the unique fixed points of their respective Bellman optimality equations.

3. **Recursive Structure**: The recursive nature of these equations allows for iterative solution methods.

**Theoretical Significance**:

1. **Optimality Guarantee**: If we can solve the Bellman optimality equations exactly, we are guaranteed to find an optimal policy.

2. **Foundation for Algorithms**: These equations form the theoretical foundation for many RL algorithms:
   - Value Iteration: Directly applies the Bellman optimality equation iteratively
   - Q-learning: Uses sample-based updates to approximate the Bellman optimality equation for Q
   - Policy Iteration: Alternates between policy evaluation (using Bellman expectation) and policy improvement

3. **Computational Challenge**: Solving these equations exactly requires:
   - Complete knowledge of the environment (P and R)
   - Computation that scales with the size of the state space
   - Hence the need for approximation methods in large or continuous state spaces

### (b) Why is Bellman optimality important for agents to learn and improve their decision-making abilities?

Bellman optimality is fundamental to reinforcement learning because it provides a rigorous mathematical foundation and practical methods for agents to learn optimal decision-making. Here's why it's so crucial:

**1. Theoretical Foundation for Optimality**:

- **Guarantees optimal solutions**: Bellman optimality equations define what it means for a policy to be optimal in an MDP.
- **Verification of optimality**: They provide a way to verify whether a policy is optimal by checking if its value function satisfies the Bellman optimality equations.
- **Unique solution**: The equations guarantee a unique optimal value function, ensuring there's a well-defined target for learning algorithms.

**2. Enables Efficient Learning Algorithms**:

- **Bootstrapping**: Bellman equations enable bootstrapping, where estimates of future values are used to update current value estimates.
- **Sample efficiency**: By leveraging the recursive structure, agents can learn from individual transitions without waiting for complete episodes.
- **Credit assignment**: Helps solve the temporal credit assignment problem by propagating rewards backward through time.

**3. Guides Exploration and Exploitation**:

- **Value-guided exploration**: By estimating action values via Bellman equations, agents can make informed exploration decisions.
- **Principled exploitation**: Knowledge of optimal values helps agents exploit what they've learned by choosing actions with highest expected return.
- **Uncertainty reduction**: The gap between current estimates and Bellman targets indicates areas where more learning is needed.

**4. Enables Incremental Improvement**:

- **Policy improvement theorem**: Guarantees that making a policy greedy with respect to its value function cannot decrease performance.
- **Monotonic improvement**: Theoretical guarantee that properly implemented algorithms will continually improve.
- **Convergence properties**: Provides conditions under which algorithms are guaranteed to converge to optimal policies.

**5. Bridges Model-Based and Model-Free Learning**:

- **Model-based planning**: When the environment model is known, Bellman equations allow direct computation of optimal policies.
- **Model-free learning**: When the model is unknown, Bellman equations guide sample-based learning from experience.
- **Transfer between approaches**: Insights from one approach can inform the other through the common Bellman framework.

**6. Practical Applications in Agent Design**:

- **Algorithm derivation**: Nearly all RL algorithms are derived from or approximate Bellman equations:
  - Q-learning uses sample-based updates to approximate Bellman optimality for Q-values
  - SARSA follows Bellman expectation equations for the current policy
  - Actor-Critic methods use Bellman equations to train the critic component

- **Error measurement**: The difference between current estimates and Bellman targets (Bellman error) serves as a natural learning signal.
- **Convergence criteria**: Provides a clear stopping condition when Bellman errors become sufficiently small.

**7. Handles Complex Decision Problems**:

- **Long-horizon planning**: Accounts for long-term consequences of actions through recursive value definitions.
- **Stochastic environments**: Properly handles uncertainty in outcomes through expectation over next states.
- **Non-linear rewards**: Optimizes for cumulative rewards that may be distributed in complex patterns over time.

In essence, Bellman optimality provides both the theoretical target that defines optimal behavior and the practical means to move toward that target through iterative improvement. This dual role makes it indispensable for reinforcement learning agents to systematically improve their decision-making abilities.

## Question 6
### (a) What is dynamic programming? How does it help agents to solve problems in reinforcement learning?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It breaks down complex problems into simpler subproblems and uses the solutions of these subproblems to solve the original problem.

**Key Characteristics of Dynamic Programming**:

1. **Optimal substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping subproblems**: The same subproblems are solved multiple times, allowing solutions to be cached and reused.
3. **Bellman equations**: DP algorithms are based on Bellman equations which provide recursive decomposition of the value function.

**Main Dynamic Programming Algorithms in RL**:

1. **Policy Evaluation**:
   - **Purpose**: Compute the value function V^π for a given policy π
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Initialize V(s) arbitrarily for all states
     - Repeat until convergence:
       - For each state s:
         - Update $V(s) ← Σ_a π(a|s)[R(s,a) + γ·Σ_s' P(s'|s,a)·V(s')]$
   - **Convergence**: Guaranteed to converge to V^π

2. **Policy Improvement**:
   - **Purpose**: Improve a policy π based on its value function V^π
   - **Algorithm**:
     - For each state s:
       - Update $π(s) ← argmax_a [R(s,a) + γ·Σ_s' P(s'|s,a)·V^π(s')]$
   - **Policy Improvement Theorem**: Guarantees that the new policy is strictly better unless the original policy was already optimal

3. **Policy Iteration**:
   - **Purpose**: Find optimal policy through iterative improvement
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Initialize policy π arbitrarily
     - Repeat until convergence:
       - Policy Evaluation: Compute V^π
       - Policy Improvement: Update π based on V^π
   - **Convergence**: Guaranteed to converge to optimal policy π* in finite number of iterations for finite MDPs

4. **Value Iteration**:
   - **Purpose**: Directly compute optimal value function V* without explicitly maintaining a policy
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Initialize V(s) arbitrarily for all states
     - Repeat until convergence:
       - For each state s:
         - Update V(s) ← max_a [R(s,a) + γ·Σ_s' P(s'|s,a)·V(s')]
   - **Convergence**: Converges to V* from which optimal policy can be derived

**How Dynamic Programming Helps RL Agents**:

1. **Exact Solution Method**:
   - Provides guaranteed optimal solutions when the MDP model is completely known
   - Serves as a theoretical benchmark for other RL methods

2. **Bootstrapping**:
   - Enables efficient learning by updating estimates based on other estimates
   - Forms the conceptual foundation for temporal difference learning

3. **Systematic Exploration of State Space**:
   - Ensures all relevant states are considered in the solution
   - Provides complete coverage of the problem space

4. **Value Function Computation**:
   - Computes state values (V) and action values (Q) that guide decision-making
   - These values capture the long-term consequences of actions

5. **Breaking Down Complex Problems**:
   - Decomposes the sequential decision problem into manageable subproblems
   - Combines solutions efficiently through recursive structure

6. **Foundation for Approximate Methods**:
   - When state spaces are too large for exact DP, its principles inspire approximate methods
   - Ideas like backup operations transfer to sample-based methods

**Limitations and Extensions**:

1. **Computational Complexity**:
   - Time complexity is O(|S|²|A|) per iteration
   - Space complexity is O(|S|) for storing value functions

2. **Need for Complete Model**:
   - Requires full knowledge of transition probabilities P(s'|s,a) and rewards R(s,a)
   - Often impractical in real-world scenarios

3. **Extensions to Address Limitations**:
   - **Asynchronous DP**: Update states in any order, not requiring full sweeps
   - **Prioritized sweeping**: Focus updates on states with potentially large changes
   - **Real-time DP**: Interleave planning with action selection

Dynamic programming provides the conceptual foundation for much of reinforcement learning, even when the full model is unknown and sampling-based methods must be used instead.

### (b) How do TD (Temporal Difference) methods assist agents in learning from experiences?

Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a fundamental approach in reinforcement learning that combines ideas from dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods. TD methods learn directly from experience without requiring a model of the environment, making them particularly powerful for real-world applications.

**Core Principles of TD Learning**:

1. **Bootstrapping**: TD methods update estimates based on other estimates, without waiting for final outcomes.
2. **Online learning**: Updates occur after each step, not just at the end of episodes.
3. **Sample-based**: Learn from actual experiences rather than requiring a complete model.

**Key TD Methods and Their Mechanisms**:

1. **TD(0) for State Value Estimation**:
   - **Update rule**: $V(S_t) ← V(S_t) + α[R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)]$
   - **TD error**: $δ_t = R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)$
   - The difference between the bootstrapped estimate $(R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}))$ and current estimate $V(S_t)$

2. **SARSA (On-policy TD Control)**:
   - **Update rule**: $Q(S_t,A_t) ← Q(S_t,A_t) + α[R_{t+1} + γQ(S_{t+1},A_{t+1}) - Q(S_t,A_t)]$
   - Uses actual next action $A_{t+1}$ selected by the current policy
   - Learns action-values of the policy being followed

3. **Q-Learning (Off-policy TD Control)**:
   - **Update rule**: $Q(S_t,A_t) ← Q(S_t,A_t) + α[R_{t+1} + γ·max_a Q(S_{t+1},a) - Q(S_t,A_t)]$
   - Uses maximum Q-value for next state regardless of what action is actually taken
   - Learns the optimal policy regardless of the policy being followed

4. **Expected SARSA**:
   - **Update rule**: $Q(S_t,A_t) ← Q(S_t,A_t) + α[R_{t+1} + γ·Σ_a π(a|S_{t+1})·Q(S_{t+1},a) - Q(S_t,A_t)]$
   - Uses the expected value of next action according to policy π
   - Reduces variance compared to SARSA while maintaining on-policy learning

**How TD Methods Assist Agents in Learning from Experiences**:

1. **Incremental Real-time Learning**:
   - **Online updates**: TD methods update value estimates after each step rather than waiting for episode completion
   - **Immediate feedback**: Errors are detected and corrected as soon as possible
   - **Continuous improvement**: Agent improves policies while interacting with the environment

2. **Efficiency Advantages**:
   - **Sample efficiency**: Makes maximal use of each experience by learning from individual transitions
   - **Computational efficiency**: Updates are simple and require minimal computation
   - **Memory efficiency**: No need to store complete episode histories

3. **Handling of Continuing Tasks**:
   - **Non-terminating environments**: TD methods work well in continuing tasks with no clear episodes
   - **Long-horizon problems**: No need to wait for delayed final outcomes that might be far in the future
   - **Persistent learning**: Can continually adapt to changing environments

4. **Error Propagation Mechanism**:
   - **Credit assignment**: TD error signal propagates reward information backward through state sequences
   - **Error chaining**: Updates to one state value affect updates to preceding states
   - **Temporal locality**: Recent states receive more accurate updates earlier

5. **Balancing Bias and Variance**:
   - **Reduced variance**: Compared to Monte Carlo methods, TD has lower variance by not depending on full returns
   - **Introduces bias**: Bootstrapping introduces bias since estimates are based on other estimates
   - **Practical advantage**: The bias-variance tradeoff often favors TD in practice

6. **Exploration and Learning**:
   - **Exploration guidance**: TD errors highlight states where predictions are inaccurate
   - **Surprise signals**: Large TD errors indicate areas where more learning is needed
   - **Policy improvement**: TD updates naturally lead to improved policies when combined with policy improvement steps

7. **Practical Implementation Benefits**:
   - **No model required**: Work directly with experience without needing transition probabilities
   - **Adaptability**: Can adjust to changes in the environment through continuous learning
   - **Robustness**: Function well even with function approximation in large state spaces

TD methods bridge the gap between planning-based approaches (like dynamic programming) and pure experiential learning (like Monte Carlo methods), offering agents a powerful framework for learning optimal behaviors through direct interaction with their environments.

## Question 7
### (a) Give a brief overview of eligibility traces.

Eligibility traces are a fundamental mechanism in reinforcement learning that bridge temporal difference (TD) and Monte Carlo methods, providing a unified framework that can accelerate learning while properly assigning credit for rewards to earlier actions.

**Definition and Concept**:

Eligibility traces are temporary records of the occurrence of events, such as visiting a state or taking an action. They indicate the degree to which each state or state-action pair is "eligible" for undergoing learning changes when a reinforcement signal arrives.

**Key Components**:

1. **Trace Decay Parameter (λ)**:
   - Controls the length of the trace (0 ≤ λ ≤ 1)
   - λ = 0 → TD(0) (one-step updates)
   - λ = 1 → Monte Carlo (full episode returns)
   - 0 < λ < 1 → Mixture of multi-step returns

2. **Accumulating Traces**:
   - When a state s is visited: e(s) ← e(s) + 1
   - All traces decay on each step: e(s) ← γλe(s) for all s
   - Where γ is the discount factor and λ is the trace decay parameter

3. **Replacing Traces**:
   - Alternative approach: e(s) ← 1 when s is visited (instead of incrementing)
   - Prevents excessive eligibility buildup in frequently visited states

**Mathematical Framework**:

1. **TD(λ) State-Value Update**:
   - For all states s: V(s) ← V(s) + αδe(s)
   - Where δ is the TD error: δ = R + γV(St+1) - V(St)

2. **SARSA(λ) Action-Value Update**:
   - For all state-action pairs (s,a): Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + αδe(s,a)
   - Where δ = R + γQ(St+1,At+1) - Q(St,At)

3. **Q(λ) Update**:
   - Similar to SARSA(λ) but uses max action value for the TD error
   - δ = R + γ·max_a Q(St+1,a) - Q(St,At)

**Theoretical Interpretation**:

1. **n-step Returns**:
   - TD(λ) implicitly combines n-step returns for different values of n
   - Uses the λ-return: Rλt = (1-λ)∑n=1∞ λn-1 Rnt
   - Where Rnt is the n-step return starting from time t

2. **Forward vs. Backward View**:
   - **Forward view**: Theoretical perspective considering future rewards (λ-return)
   - **Backward view**: Practical implementation using eligibility traces
   - These views are equivalent in the offline case (batch updating)

**Benefits in Reinforcement Learning**:

1. **Credit Assignment**:
   - **Temporal credit allocation**: Properly assigns credit to earlier states/actions
   - **Bridging temporal gaps**: Helps with problems where rewards are significantly delayed

2. **Learning Efficiency**:
   - **Faster convergence**: Often achieves better learning speed than pure TD or Monte Carlo
   - **Reduced variance**: Compared to Monte Carlo while maintaining lower bias than one-step TD

3. **Parameter Flexibility**:
   - **Adaptable algorithm**: λ can be tuned to optimize performance for specific problems
   - **Generalized approach**: Encompasses TD(0) and Monte Carlo as special cases

**Practical Considerations**:

1. **Computational Requirements**:
   - Requires maintaining eligibility traces for all states or state-action pairs
   - More computationally intensive than basic TD methods
   - Implementation tricks can mitigate computational costs

2. **Online vs. Offline Updates**:
   - Work for both online (during episode) and offline (between episodes) learning
   - Most beneficial in online settings where immediate learning is valuable

3. **Function Approximation**:
   - Compatible with function approximation through feature traces
   - For linear function approximation: e ← λγe + ∇Q(St,At)

Eligibility traces represent one of the most important concepts in reinforcement learning, providing both theoretical elegance in unifying different learning approaches and practical benefits for learning speed and efficacy.

### (b) What is the use of Function Approximation? Explain its two types.

Function Approximation in reinforcement learning is a technique used to generalize value functions and policies across large or continuous state spaces where tabular methods become impractical. It enables RL agents to estimate values for states they have never explicitly encountered, based on similarity to previously experienced states.

**Purpose and Uses of Function Approximation**:

1. **Handling Large State Spaces**:
   - Tabular methods require storing a separate value for each state-action pair
   - Becomes infeasible when state spaces are very large or continuous
   - Example: Chess has approximately 10^43 possible board positions

2. **Generalization**:
   - Allows learning from limited experience to generalize to novel situations
   - Transfers knowledge between similar states
   - Infers values for unseen states based on patterns in observed states

3. **Sample Efficiency**:
   - Reduces number of samples needed to learn good policies
   - Updates to one state affect values of similar states
   - Makes learning practical in complex environments

4. **Continuous State Spaces**:
   - Enables handling of truly continuous state variables
   - Provides smooth value function approximations
   - Necessary for real-world physical systems with continuous measurements

5. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Transforms raw state data into meaningful features
   - Reduces dimensionality of the problem
   - Incorporates domain knowledge into learning process

**Two Main Types of Function Approximation**:

### 1. Parametric Function Approximation

Parametric methods use a fixed structure with a finite number of adjustable parameters to represent the value function.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Fixed number of parameters regardless of amount of data
- Structure of the function is predetermined
- Learning involves optimizing parameter values

**Common Examples**:

a) **Linear Function Approximation**:
   - Value function represented as V(s) = w^T·φ(s) or Q(s,a) = w^T·φ(s,a)
   - Where w is a parameter vector and φ(s) is a feature vector
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple, computationally efficient updates
     - Theoretical convergence guarantees with certain algorithms
     - Works well when good features are available
   - **Limitations**:
     - Limited expressiveness
     - Requires good feature engineering

b) **Neural Networks**:
   - Value function represented as complex non-linear function of inputs
   - Multiple layers process information hierarchically
   - **Advantages**:
     - Highly expressive, can represent complex functions
     - Automatic feature extraction from raw inputs
     - Scalable to very large problems
   - **Limitations**:
     - Risk of instability in training
     - Computationally intensive
     - Often requires large amounts of data

c) **Polynomial Approximation**:
   - Uses polynomials of state variables: V(s) = θ_0 + θ_1·s + θ_2·s^2 + ...
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple implementation
     - Interpretable parameters
   - **Limitations**:
     - Suffers from curse of dimensionality
     - Unstable extrapolation behavior

### 2. Non-parametric Function Approximation

Non-parametric methods don't have a fixed structure, and the complexity of the representation can grow with the amount of data.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Number of parameters depends on training data
- Structure adapts based on observed samples
- Requires storing training examples or derived information

**Common Examples**:

a) **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**:
   - Value of a state is average of k nearest training examples
   - V(s) = (1/k)·Σ V(s_i) for the k nearest s_i to s
   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple to implement
     - No training phase required
     - Works well with sufficient data
   - **Limitations**:
     - Computationally expensive during inference
     - Sensitive to distance metric choice
     - Memory-intensive (stores all examples)

b) **Decision Trees and Random Forests**:
   - Partition state space into regions with similar values
   - **Advantages**:
     - Handle mixed feature types
     - Interpretable decisions
     - Robust to irrelevant features
   - **Limitations**:
     - Discontinuous approximations
     - Potential overfitting
     - Can be unstable

c) **Gaussian Processes**:
   - Bayesian approach modeling value function as distribution over functions
   - **Advantages**:
     - Provides uncertainty estimates
     - Performs well with limited data
     - Flexible modeling of complex functions
   - **Limitations**:
     - Computationally expensive for large datasets
     - Sensitive to hyperparameter choices

**Comparison and Selection Criteria**:

| Aspect | Parametric | Non-parametric |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Memory requirements | Generally low | Often high (scales with data) |
| Training speed | Usually faster | Often slower |
| Inference speed | Fast | Can be slow |
| Sample efficiency | Typically lower | Usually higher |
| Prior knowledge | Encoded in model structure | Minimal assumptions |
| Adaptability | Limited by fixed structure | Adapts with more data |
| Appropriate use | When structure is known, data is plentiful | When structure is unknown, data is limited |

The choice between parametric and non-parametric methods depends on factors such as the amount of data available, prior knowledge about the problem structure, computational constraints, and the complexity of the value function being approximated.

## Question 8
### (a) Discuss the Least Squares Methods used in reinforcement learning.

Least Squares Methods in reinforcement learning are a family of techniques that use batch processing to find value function parameters that minimize the sum of squared prediction errors across a set of training examples. These methods provide closed-form solutions to the function approximation problem, offering an alternative to incremental gradient-based updates.

**Foundational Concept**:

Least Squares methods aim to find the parameter vector θ that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted values and target values:

MSE(θ) = (1/n)·Σ(y_i - f_θ(x_i))²

where y_i are target values and f_θ(x_i) are predicted values using parameters θ.

**Key Least Squares Methods in RL**:

1. **Least Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD)**:
   
   **Purpose**: Directly computes TD fixed point without iterative updates.
   
   **Algorithm**:
   - Collect samples (s, a, r, s') from environment interaction
   - Form matrices A and b where:
     - A = Σ φ(s)[φ(s) - γφ(s')]^T
     - b = Σ φ(s)r
   - Solve for parameter vector: θ = A⁻¹b
   
   **Advantages**:
   - Data efficient compared to incremental TD
   - No learning rate parameter to tune
   - Finds exact solution for the samples available
   
   **Limitations**:
   - Matrix inversion can be computationally expensive
   - Requires storing all samples (or sufficient statistics)
   - May be unstable with insufficient samples

2. **Least Squares Policy Evaluation (LSPE)**:

   **Purpose**: Combines aspects of TD and Monte Carlo evaluation with least squares.
   
   **Algorithm**:
   - Iteratively update parameters: θ_{k+1} = θ_k + α(A⁻¹b - θ_k)
   - A and b are constructed similarly to LSTD
   
   **Advantages**:
   - More stable than LSTD in some settings
   - Control over convergence speed via α parameter
   - Blends incremental and batch approaches
   
   **Limitations**:
   - Still requires matrix inversion
   - Potentially slower convergence than LSTD

3. **Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI)**:

   **Purpose**: Combines least squares policy evaluation with policy improvement.
   
   **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize policy π
   - Repeat until convergence:
     - Collect samples using current policy
     - Estimate Q-function using LSTDQ (LSTD for Q-values)
     - Improve policy: π(s) = argmax_a Q(s,a)
   
   **Advantages**:
   - Model-free approach to find optimal policies
   - Often more sample-efficient than value-iteration approaches
   - Works well with moderate-sized problems
   
   **Limitations**:
   - Policy evaluation stage can be computationally intensive
   - Sensitive to feature representation quality

4. **Recursive Least Squares TD (RLS-TD)**:

   **Purpose**: Incremental version of LSTD that avoids storing all samples.
   
   **Algorithm**:
   - Maintains estimate of inverse correlation matrix P
   - Updates P and θ incrementally with each new sample
   - Uses matrix inversion lemma to avoid direct inversions
   
   **Advantages**:
   - Combines benefits of least squares with online learning
   - No need to store all samples
   - Adapts to non-stationary problems
   
   **Limitations**:
   - Higher computational cost per step than simple TD
   - Still requires O(d²) memory for d features
   - Numerical stability concerns

**Implementation Considerations**:

1. **Regularization**:
   - Add regularization term λI to matrix A to ensure invertibility
   - Helps prevent overfitting with limited data
   - Effectively implements ridge regression: θ = (A + λI)⁻¹b

2. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - For large feature spaces, use approximate methods:
     - Low-rank approximations
     - Random projections
     - Incremental SVD

3. **Sample Collection**:
   - Performance depends on quality and distribution of samples
   - Ideally collect samples that cover important parts of state space
   - Can be combined with exploration strategies for better coverage

**Comparison with Other Approaches**:

| Method | Sample Efficiency | Computational Cost | Online Learning | Stability |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Least Squares | High | High (O(d³) for d features) | Batch (or RLS for online) | Sensitive to feature correlation |
| Gradient TD | Moderate | Low per update | Yes | More robust |
| Q-learning with FA | Lower | Very low per update | Yes | Can diverge with function approximation |

Least Squares methods are particularly valuable in scenarios where data collection is expensive, computational resources are available for batch processing, and a good feature representation has been identified. They represent an important class of algorithms in the reinforcement learning toolkit, especially for problems with moderate dimensionality and limited samples.

#### (iii) Policy Gradient

Policy Gradient methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that directly optimize the policy without explicitly computing value functions, making them particularly suitable for continuous action spaces and stochastic policies.

**Fundamental Principles**:

1. **Direct Policy Optimization**:
   - Parametrizes policy directly: π_θ(a|s)

## Question 9
### (a) What are the advantages of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning?

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) extends traditional RL by decomposing complex problems into hierarchical structures of sub-problems. This approach offers numerous advantages that address fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning.

**Key Advantages of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**:

1. **Temporal Abstraction**:
   - **Time scale separation**: Decisions can be made at different time scales
   - **Extended actions**: Higher-level policies select "options" or "skills" that execute for multiple time steps
   - **Planning horizon reduction**: Reduces the effective planning horizon by reasoning with temporally extended actions
   - **Example benefit**: In a robot navigation task, instead of planning each motor command, plan at the level of "go to room X"

2. **State Abstraction**:
   - **Dimensionality reduction**: Different levels of the hierarchy can use different state representations
   - **Irrelevant feature filtering**: Higher levels can ignore details only relevant to lower-level execution
   - **Modular representations**: Each subtask can have its own tailored state representation
   - **Example benefit**: A robot can focus on room locations at high level while considering detailed obstacle positions only at lower levels

3. **Improved Exploration**:
   - **Guided exploration**: Higher-level policies can guide exploration to promising regions
   - **Structured search**: Explores in the space of temporally extended actions rather than primitive actions
   - **Intrinsic motivation**: Natural framework for curiosity and skill discovery
   - **Example benefit**: Instead of random exploration, the agent can explore by trying different high-level strategies

4. **Transfer Learning**:
   - **Skill reuse**: Low-level skills can be reused across tasks and environments
   - **Compositional learning**: New behaviors can be composed from previously learned components
   - **Knowledge sharing**: Information learned for one subtask can benefit others
   - **Example benefit**: A robot that learns to walk can reuse this skill when learning to play soccer

5. **Sample Efficiency**:
   - **Reduced search space**: Constrains exploration to relevant regions
   - **Prior knowledge incorporation**: Hierarchy can encode domain knowledge
   - **Curriculum learning**: Natural progression from simple to complex skills
   - **Example benefit**: Learning complex tasks in millions rather than billions of environment interactions

6. **Handling Sparse Rewards**:
   - **Reward decomposition**: Different levels can have different reward functions
   - **Intrinsic rewards**: Subtask completion can provide dense feedback
   - **Credit assignment**: Easier to associate rewards with responsible decisions
   - **Example benefit**: A robot can get rewarded for completing subtasks even when the final goal is distant

7. **Interpretability and Explainability**:
   - **Understandable structure**: Hierarchical policies have meaningful decompositions
   - **Transparent decision-making**: Clearer why certain actions were chosen
   - **Easier debugging**: Isolate and fix issues in specific components
   - **Example benefit**: Understanding that the agent first decided to "go to the kitchen" before "open the refrigerator"

8. **Scalability to Complex Tasks**:
   - **Divide and conquer**: Breaking complex problems into manageable subproblems
   - **Logarithmic complexity reduction**: Can potentially reduce exponential complexity to polynomial
   - **Parallel learning**: Different components can be learned simultaneously
   - **Example benefit**: Enabling reinforcement learning for real-world tasks like robotic manipulation in unstructured environments

9. **Dealing with Non-Stationarity**:
   - **Modular adaptation**: Different levels can adapt at different rates
   - **Stable abstractions**: High-level policies can remain stable while low-level details change
   - **Robust performance**: Overall system more resilient to environmental changes
   - **Example benefit**: A robot can adapt low-level motor controls to a new surface without changing high-level navigation strategy

10. **Integration with Other Learning Paradigms**:
    - **Supervised pretraining**: Skills can be initialized via imitation learning
    - **Meta-learning compatibility**: Natural framework for learning to learn
    - **Hybrid systems**: Different levels can use different algorithms (RL, planning, etc.)
    - **Example benefit**: Using supervised learning for low-level controllers and RL for high-level decision making

These advantages have made HRL increasingly important for applications in robotics, game playing, resource management, and other complex sequential decision-making domains. By addressing fundamental limitations of flat RL approaches, hierarchical methods push the boundaries of what's possible with reinforcement learning.

### (b) Describe the key components of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) organizes decision-making into multiple levels of abstraction. The key components of HRL frameworks enable temporal and state abstraction, creating more efficient and scalable learning architectures.

**1. Temporal Abstraction Mechanisms**:

a) **Options Framework**:
   - **Definition**: An option is a temporally extended action consisting of:
     - **Initiation set**: States where the option can begin
     - **Policy**: The behavior to follow during execution
     - **Termination condition**: Probability of ending the option at each state
   - **Execution flow**: When an option is selected, its policy is followed until the termination condition is met
   - **Semi-Markov property**: Options may take variable amounts of time to complete

b) **Hierarchical Abstract Machines (HAMs)**:
   - **Structure**: Non-deterministic finite state machines that constrain the actions available
   - **Components**: Machine states, transitions, and choice points
   - **Execution**: Machine states restrict which primitive actions can be taken
   - **Learning**: RL occurs at choice points within the machine

c) **Macro-actions**:
   - **Definition**: Fixed sequences of primitive actions
   - **Simplicity**: Simpler than options as they don't have internal policies
   - **Limitations**: Less flexible than full options

**2. State Abstraction Components**:

a) **State Aggregation**:
   - **Purpose**: Groups similar states to reduce state space size
   - **Implementation**: Maps original states to abstract states
   - **Benefit**: Different levels can use different aggregation schemes

b) **Feature Selection**:
   - **Purpose**: Uses only relevant features at each level
   - **Implementation**: Different state representations for different subtasks
   - **Example**: High-level navigation might use only position, ignoring orientation

c) **Factored State Representations**:
   - **Structure**: Represents state as a collection of variables/factors
   - **Advantage**: Different components can access only relevant factors
   - **Implementation**: Dynamic Bayesian Networks or similar structures

**3. Hierarchical Policy Structures**:

a) **Hierarchical Policy**:
   - **Definition**: Policies organized in a hierarchical structure
